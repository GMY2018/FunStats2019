This is a R Shiny app used on the 2019 BGS Open Day for a simple demostration of collecting and analysing data. 
It takes basic travel information from visitors, and then produce a rough estimation of carbon footprint of the visitor's journey to the BGS head office in Keyworth, Nottingham.

* To run the app, you will need the following R packages

shiny, leaflet, maps, rgeos, geosphere, gmapsdistance, stringr, rdrop2

Then type runGitHub(repo='FunStats2019', username='GMY2018') to run the app.

** Alternatively, the app can be accessed using the following link

*** If you want to use the app to collect lots of data, or modified the code to make it your own app, you might wish to acquire your own Google map API keys. This app uses a free API version which has a cap on the number of quires you can make in a fixed period of time.
